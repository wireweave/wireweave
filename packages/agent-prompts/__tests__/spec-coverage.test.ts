/**
 * The prompt is prose, but the element names in it are still a copy of the DSL
 * element set — and an LLM cannot generate an element the prompt never mentions.
 *
 * This repository-level contract reads Core's spec source directly: add an
 * element to the grammar and this fails until the prompt documents it. A
 * relative test import deliberately avoids making the published prompts
 * artifact depend on Core solely for a monorepo validation concern. The prose
 * itself stays hand-written; only its coverage is enforced.
 *
 * "Documents it" is the load-bearing word. Asking only whether the name occurs
 * somewhere in the prompt is a gate that cannot fail for any element whose name
 * is also an ordinary English word: `list` matches "the message list", `item`
 * matches "peer items", `layout` matches "semantic layout". Those are prose
 * coincidences, and an element covered only by one is an element the prompt
 * never taught. So coverage is measured against the prompt's *catalogue entries*
 * — the positions where it is defining an element rather than talking around one
 * — and an element counts as documented only when it heads one of them.
