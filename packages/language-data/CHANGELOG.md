### Minor Changes

- [`af53020`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/af5302012ce5654f9d5b225adaeaefa57af3854c) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - feat: `when=` — scope an element to the variant boards that draw it

  `variants=[loading, empty, ready]` says how many boards a page draws. It had no
  way to say which of them draws a given element, so every board drew everything
  and a screen's states could only differ by what a `visibleWhen` guard hid at
  runtime — which is a different thing, and visible in the artifact as controls the
  product does not have.

  `when=loading` scopes an element to one board; `when=[loading, empty]` scopes it
  to several. The list is a disjunction, and that is the reason the attribute
  exists: a guard offers only `equals`, so a block belonging to two conditions had
  to be authored twice, and two copies drift apart while a reviewer cannot tell
  whether the difference is deliberate. A header shared by three states is now one
  header. An element with no `when` is drawn on every board, so the common chrome
  of a screen stays written once and every document that predates the attribute
  renders unchanged.

  Orthogonal to `visibleWhen`, deliberately and testably. A guard is a runtime
  fact — the element is in every board's markup, carries `data-wf-visible-when`,
  and the site runtime shows and hides it as state changes. `when` is a build-time
  fact: the element is _absent_ from the markup of every board it does not name, so
  nothing can toggle it back. One element may carry both — `when=ready
visibleWhen={…}` means "only on the ready board, and there only while the guard
  passes" — and the two are kept in separate interfaces (`VariantScopedProps`,
  `GuardedOutcomeProps`) so a later refactor cannot quietly collapse them into one
  mechanism.

  Filtering happens inside `expandVariants`, at the moment each board is cloned,
  because that is the only point where the board's name is in hand: before
  expansion there is no board to ask about, and after it a separate pass would have
  to rediscover the association by walking the document again. The rule is one
  sentence — an element is drawn on a board iff its `when` set contains that
  board's variant — and the remaining cases fall out of it rather than being
  special-cased. A page declaring no `variants=` is an unnamed board, which no
  scope contains, so a `when` there draws the element nowhere; `validate()` reports
  that, along with a name absent from the page's own list and a child whose scope
  is disjoint from an ancestor's, because `when` deletes rather than styles and a
  silent misspelling costs the whole subtree.

  Every element accepts it, via `BOX_ATTRIBUTES` — which states a screen's piece
  belongs to is a property of the piece, not of what kind of piece it is. `page` is
  the one exception: a page _is_ a board, so scoping one would be a board naming
  which board it is drawn on.

  spec-surface-baseline: GREW — every element gained `when` (new writable syntax;
  no document stops validating).

## 1.6.0-beta.3

### Minor Changes

- [`2b9cea0`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/2b9cea0bbeb322ac70c29686cd56c8e504defa0e) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - feat: `page … variants=[…]` — draw a screen's states as separate boards

  A screen usually has to be shown loading, empty, populated and failed. Until now
  the only way to say that was `states=` plus `visibleWhen` guards plus a control
  that flips the state, and all three costs land in the artifact: the wireframe
  carries state-switching buttons the product does not have, so a reviewer cannot
  tell them from real UI; only one condition is visible at a time; and any block
  two conditions share is written twice, because a guard has no disjunction.

  `variants=[loading, empty, ready]` moves the same information from a toggle
  inside the screen to an axis of the document. The page is drawn once per name, as
  that many independent boards, and none of them contains a way to switch — there
  is nothing to switch to, because the other states are already on the page beside
  it. The shared blocks stay shared, because it is still one authored body.

  This is orthogonal to `states`, which keeps its meaning unchanged. A state is a
  runtime value the site runtime flips and guards read; a variant is a property of
  the artifact. A page may declare both, and a page that does contributes its
  `states` once rather than once per board.

  Expansion happens in `expandVariants`, over the document, on the way to a
  rendered tree — the same place and for the same reasons as `repeat`. Not the
  parser, so the AST keeps the list, the printer writes it back out, and the corpus
  round-trip law holds. Before the renderer builds its anchor index, because that
  index is keyed by node object identity: boards sharing a child tree would leave
  every board but the first without a `data-wf-path`. Every board is therefore a
  distinct clone that keeps the `loc` of the page it came from, which is accurate —
  all of them originate at one span of source.

  Both render surfaces run the pass, so `render` counts the boards on its canvas
  and `renderSite` builds a screen for each, rather than each deciding separately
  what a variant is. Boards composed into a shell share that one shell, which is
  still emitted once, and each board gets its own id scope.

  Addressing keeps one resolution rule. The bare name still resolves — to the first
  variant, which is the one the author wrote first — so `navigate=orders` behaves
  as it always did, and each board is additionally addressable as `orders#loading`.
  The separator is `#` because a screen address is already a URL fragment, and
  because it cannot appear in a bare identifier, so a variant target must be
  written quoted and is visibly deliberate.

  Documents that declare no variants are unaffected: expansion returns them
  unchanged, identity included, and their screen model, canvas and site output are
  byte-for-byte what they were.

## 1.6.0-beta.2

### Minor Changes

- [`ef8f7c3`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/ef8f7c3032c9291c26ff941c954ad6513150e6ff) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - feat: `repeat N { … }` — fold repeated siblings instead of pasting them

  Six identical skeleton cards had to be written out six times, so the duplication
  a wireframe language exists to avoid was being maintained by hand. `repeat 6 {
use skeletonCard() }` states the count once.

  It is deliberately a count and nothing else. There is no index variable: an
  index is what lets copies differ, and copies that differ are data binding rather
  than a wireframe. The feature narrows what has to be typed, not what can be
  expressed.

  `repeat` expands on the way to a rendered tree, in `expandRepeats`, and not in
  the parser. The AST keeps the node so the printer can write `repeat 6` back out
  and the round-trip law holds; expanding at parse time would return six bodies
  where the source had one. It is not expanded in the linker either, because
  `linkApp` runs only under `compileApp` while the CLI, SDK, MCP server, markdown
  plugin, editor extension and UX rules all reach the tree through `parse` and
  `render` — expansion there would leave the syntax inert everywhere else.

  Expansion runs over the whole document before the renderer builds its anchor
  index, because that index is keyed by node object identity: copies created
  afterwards would carry no `data-wf-path` and the anchor count would stop
  matching the index. Every copy is therefore a distinct clone. Copies keep the
  `loc` of the body they came from, which is accurate — all of them do originate
  at one span of source — and stay individually addressable through their anchor
  paths, which are child indices and so differ by position.

  `repeat 0` draws nothing and `repeat 1` draws the body once; both parse and
  validate. Negative and fractional counts are rejected by the grammar, which
  accepts only a non-negative integer. Nesting works and multiplies, so the guard
  is a budget on the expanded total rather than a cap on any single count:
  expansion past 500 nodes is refused, ten times the `MAX_PAGE_ELEMENTS` ceiling
  `ux-rules` already warns at, leaving an order of magnitude in which a document
  is complained about but still drawn.

- [`2f7cc70`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/2f7cc7042da1170bef2f103f7ac25c7d0db3f4c9) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - feat: derive the editor vocabulary from `@wireweave/core/spec`

  The element set, attribute names, value domains and descriptions this package
  offers to Monaco and CodeMirror were maintained as a parallel transcription of
  the DSL specification. A parallel copy drifts silently: an attribute added to
  the grammar simply never reached autocomplete, and nothing failed.

  They are now read from `@wireweave/core/spec`, which derives them from the
  grammar itself. Only genuinely editor-side concerns remain declared here —
  example snippets, parent/child hints, and the two documented gap categories in
  `core-spec-gaps.ts` (source spellings the grammar desugars, which correctly
  have no attribute spec, and a shrinking list of attributes core has yet to
  declare). Sync tests assert those lists stay disjoint from core, so the moment
  core adopts an entry the build fails until it is deleted here.

  This adds `@wireweave/core` as a runtime dependency of
  `@wireweave/language-data`; it was previously a peer of the editor integrations
  only. Consumers already installing both are unaffected.

### Patch Changes

- [`2f7cc70`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/2f7cc7042da1170bef2f103f7ac25c7d0db3f4c9) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - chore: declare the supported Node version on every published package

  Six of the eight packages declared no `engines` at all, so npm installed them
  onto any Node version without a word. The two that did — `@wireweave/cli`
  (`>=18`) and `@wireweave/sdk` (`>=20`) — claimed support for runtimes nothing
  in this repository has ever built or tested against, and were unsatisfiable
  besides: both depend transitively on `@wireweave/core`, so their real floor was
  whatever core's is.

  All eight now declare `node: >=22.13.0`, the version `.nvmrc` pins and the only
  one CI runs. This narrows the advertised range for `cli` and `sdk`; it does not
  narrow what actually worked, it stops advertising support that was never there.

- [`2f7cc70`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/2f7cc7042da1170bef2f103f7ac25c7d0db3f4c9) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - fix: correct the legacy entry fields both packages publish

  `main` is the CommonJS fallback for resolvers that do not read `exports`, and
  `module` is the bundler convention for the ESM build. Both packages pointed
  `main` at the ESM `dist/index.js` while shipping a perfectly good
  `dist/index.cjs`, so a consumer old enough to fall back to `main` got ESM
  syntax it could not parse. `@wireweave/core` additionally set
  `module: dist/index.mjs`, a file tsup has never emitted — webpack, rollup, and
  any vite config that honours `module` resolved core to nothing.

  Both now match the rest of the workspace: `main: dist/index.cjs`,
  `module: dist/index.js`. Modern resolution is unaffected — the `exports` maps
  were already correct and take precedence.

- [`2f7cc70`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/2f7cc7042da1170bef2f103f7ac25c7d0db3f4c9) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - fix: serve CommonJS consumers CommonJS type declarations

  Each of these packages ships both an ESM and a CJS build but declared a single
  `exports` `"types"` entry pointing at the ESM `.d.ts`. TypeScript resolves types
  through the same condition it resolves code, so a consumer doing
  `require('@wireweave/core')` under `moduleResolution: node16`/`bundler` was
  handed declarations that only typecheck when the package is dynamically
  imported — the types said "ESM" while the code said "CJS".

  The maps now split `import` and `require`, each with its own `types`, matching
  the shape `@wireweave/agent-prompts` already used. Every subpath is covered, and
  the `.d.cts` files they point at were already being emitted. No entry point was added or
  removed and every path resolves to the same code as before.

- [`2f7cc70`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/2f7cc7042da1170bef2f103f7ac25c7d0db3f4c9) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - chore: declare `sideEffects: false` on the packages that have none

  Bundlers use this field to decide whether a module may be dropped entirely when
  none of its exports are used. Five packages qualified and none said so, which
  cost consumers dead code in every build that imported one of them for a single
  symbol.

  The claim is verified rather than asserted. `pnpm sideeffects:check` imports
  every `exports` entry of every package making the claim, each in its own
  process, and compares globals, builtin prototypes and `process.env` across the
  import while capturing stdout/stderr from outside and enforcing filesystem,
  process and worker access through Node's permission model. A package is covered
  the moment it adds the field, and the gate fails rather than passing vacuously
  if the set making the claim is ever empty.
