### Major Changes

- [`7124690`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/7124690f6d0d2e109f5019b796ebe8000c36611c) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - Publish the Wireweave 4.0 AppBundle contract: deterministic module admission,
  linking, compilation, runtime interaction, source maps and standalone HTML
  artifacts. The 4.0 language/runtime contract is consumed by Studio through the
  published beta package rather than a source checkout or copied dist.

## 3.1.0-beta.11

### Patch Changes

- fix: keep layout state scoped per rendered document and normalize generated parser output

  Core now preserves layout state per rendered document instead of allowing one
  document's runtime state to affect another. Its generated parser and grammar
  metadata are also normalized deterministically so source and generated
  artifacts remain stable across builds.

## 3.1.0-beta.10

### Patch Changes

- [`a85390d`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/a85390d0b45b72de6db63afbe3bf2565ca0cd89c) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - fix: stop the site gutter narrowing boards, and mark component invocations with `data-` instead of a class

  Two render defects, both found by rendering a real 14-board document and
  measuring the result rather than reading the markup.

  **The horizontal gutter came out of the board's own width.** `body` is a block
  box, so its `width: auto` resolves to the viewport minus its own horizontal
  padding: `padding: 24px` made the containing block 1440 - 24*2 = 1392px, while a
  board authored for the 1440px desktop viewport is a 1440px `.wf-page` that must
  not shrink (`flex-shrink: 0`, the fixed-layout invariant). Every desktop
  document therefore overhung its parent by 24px on each side and scrolled
  sideways. `box-sizing` cannot correct it — that reinterprets an *explicit\* width
  and there is none here. The gutter now applies only on the vertical axis, where
  a document scrolls by nature and the leading costs nothing; horizontally the
  board fills the viewport exactly as authored, and a board wider than the window
  still keeps its width and scrolls by its own overflow.

  **A component invocation carried a class no stylesheet defined.**
  `renderComponentUse` emitted `wf-component-instance`, which no rule in the
  generated CSS defined and nothing read. The wrapper declares `display: contents`
  so that it has no box and its children lay out as though it were not there;
  any rule giving it a box would defeat that, so there is no style the class could
  ever legitimately carry. The identity exists to be queried, not painted, and now
  lives only in the `data-wf-component` / `data-wf-instance` attributes that
  already carried it.

  The dead-CSS test previously checked one direction — a styled class must reach
  the markup. It now checks both, so a class the markup wears while the stylesheet
  leaves it undefined fails too. The documented boundary that component
  interactions require the linked path (`linkAndCompileApp`), because a handler in
  a definition targets an unbound parameter until the linker binds the
  invocation's inputs, is pinned by tests as well.

## 3.1.0-beta.9

### Minor Changes

- [`af53020`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/af5302012ce5654f9d5b225adaeaefa57af3854c) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - feat: `when=` — scope an element to the variant boards that draw it

  `variants=[loading, empty, ready]` says how many boards a page draws. It had no
  way to say which of them draws a given element, so every board drew everything
  and a screen's states could only differ by what a `visibleWhen` guard hid at
  runtime — which is a different thing, and visible in the artifact as controls the
  product does not have.

  `when=loading` scopes an element to one board; `when=[loading, empty]` scopes it
  to several. The list is a disjunction, and that is the reason the attribute
  exists: a guard offers only `equals`, so a block belonging to two conditions had
  to be authored twice, and two copies drift apart while a reviewer cannot tell
  whether the difference is deliberate. A header shared by three states is now one
  header. An element with no `when` is drawn on every board, so the common chrome
  of a screen stays written once and every document that predates the attribute
  renders unchanged.

  Orthogonal to `visibleWhen`, deliberately and testably. A guard is a runtime
  fact — the element is in every board's markup, carries `data-wf-visible-when`,
  and the site runtime shows and hides it as state changes. `when` is a build-time
  fact: the element is _absent_ from the markup of every board it does not name, so
  nothing can toggle it back. One element may carry both — `when=ready
visibleWhen={…}` means "only on the ready board, and there only while the guard
  passes" — and the two are kept in separate interfaces (`VariantScopedProps`,
  `GuardedOutcomeProps`) so a later refactor cannot quietly collapse them into one
  mechanism.

  Filtering happens inside `expandVariants`, at the moment each board is cloned,
  because that is the only point where the board's name is in hand: before
  expansion there is no board to ask about, and after it a separate pass would have
  to rediscover the association by walking the document again. The rule is one
  sentence — an element is drawn on a board iff its `when` set contains that
  board's variant — and the remaining cases fall out of it rather than being
  special-cased. A page declaring no `variants=` is an unnamed board, which no
  scope contains, so a `when` there draws the element nowhere; `validate()` reports
  that, along with a name absent from the page's own list and a child whose scope
  is disjoint from an ancestor's, because `when` deletes rather than styles and a
  silent misspelling costs the whole subtree.

  Every element accepts it, via `BOX_ATTRIBUTES` — which states a screen's piece
  belongs to is a property of the piece, not of what kind of piece it is. `page` is
  the one exception: a page _is_ a board, so scoping one would be a board naming
  which board it is drawn on.

  spec-surface-baseline: GREW — every element gained `when` (new writable syntax;
  no document stops validating).

## 3.1.0-beta.8

### Minor Changes

- [`2b9cea0`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/2b9cea0bbeb322ac70c29686cd56c8e504defa0e) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - feat: `page … variants=[…]` — draw a screen's states as separate boards

  A screen usually has to be shown loading, empty, populated and failed. Until now
  the only way to say that was `states=` plus `visibleWhen` guards plus a control
  that flips the state, and all three costs land in the artifact: the wireframe
  carries state-switching buttons the product does not have, so a reviewer cannot
  tell them from real UI; only one condition is visible at a time; and any block
  two conditions share is written twice, because a guard has no disjunction.

  `variants=[loading, empty, ready]` moves the same information from a toggle
  inside the screen to an axis of the document. The page is drawn once per name, as
  that many independent boards, and none of them contains a way to switch — there
  is nothing to switch to, because the other states are already on the page beside
  it. The shared blocks stay shared, because it is still one authored body.

  This is orthogonal to `states`, which keeps its meaning unchanged. A state is a
  runtime value the site runtime flips and guards read; a variant is a property of
  the artifact. A page may declare both, and a page that does contributes its
  `states` once rather than once per board.

  Expansion happens in `expandVariants`, over the document, on the way to a
  rendered tree — the same place and for the same reasons as `repeat`. Not the
  parser, so the AST keeps the list, the printer writes it back out, and the corpus
  round-trip law holds. Before the renderer builds its anchor index, because that
  index is keyed by node object identity: boards sharing a child tree would leave
  every board but the first without a `data-wf-path`. Every board is therefore a
  distinct clone that keeps the `loc` of the page it came from, which is accurate —
  all of them originate at one span of source.

  Both render surfaces run the pass, so `render` counts the boards on its canvas
  and `renderSite` builds a screen for each, rather than each deciding separately
  what a variant is. Boards composed into a shell share that one shell, which is
  still emitted once, and each board gets its own id scope.

  Addressing keeps one resolution rule. The bare name still resolves — to the first
  variant, which is the one the author wrote first — so `navigate=orders` behaves
  as it always did, and each board is additionally addressable as `orders#loading`.
  The separator is `#` because a screen address is already a URL fragment, and
  because it cannot appear in a bare identifier, so a variant target must be
  written quoted and is visibly deliberate.

  Documents that declare no variants are unaffected: expansion returns them
  unchanged, identity included, and their screen model, canvas and site output are
  byte-for-byte what they were.

## 3.1.0-beta.7

### Minor Changes

- [`ef8f7c3`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/ef8f7c3032c9291c26ff941c954ad6513150e6ff) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - feat: `repeat N { … }` — fold repeated siblings instead of pasting them

  Six identical skeleton cards had to be written out six times, so the duplication
  a wireframe language exists to avoid was being maintained by hand. `repeat 6 {
use skeletonCard() }` states the count once.

  It is deliberately a count and nothing else. There is no index variable: an
  index is what lets copies differ, and copies that differ are data binding rather
  than a wireframe. The feature narrows what has to be typed, not what can be
  expressed.

  `repeat` expands on the way to a rendered tree, in `expandRepeats`, and not in
  the parser. The AST keeps the node so the printer can write `repeat 6` back out
  and the round-trip law holds; expanding at parse time would return six bodies
  where the source had one. It is not expanded in the linker either, because
  `linkApp` runs only under `compileApp` while the CLI, SDK, MCP server, markdown
  plugin, editor extension and UX rules all reach the tree through `parse` and
  `render` — expansion there would leave the syntax inert everywhere else.

  Expansion runs over the whole document before the renderer builds its anchor
  index, because that index is keyed by node object identity: copies created
  afterwards would carry no `data-wf-path` and the anchor count would stop
  matching the index. Every copy is therefore a distinct clone. Copies keep the
  `loc` of the body they came from, which is accurate — all of them do originate
  at one span of source — and stay individually addressable through their anchor
  paths, which are child indices and so differ by position.

  `repeat 0` draws nothing and `repeat 1` draws the body once; both parse and
  validate. Negative and fractional counts are rejected by the grammar, which
  accepts only a non-negative integer. Nesting works and multiplies, so the guard
  is a budget on the expanded total rather than a cap on any single count:
  expansion past 500 nodes is refused, ten times the `MAX_PAGE_ELEMENTS` ceiling
  `ux-rules` already warns at, leaving an order of magnitude in which a document
  is complained about but still drawn.

## 3.1.0-beta.6

### Patch Changes

- [`8853f3a`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/8853f3ae77cc348c8527c2ccff032a7997cc1ce7) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - fix: check component parameter references wherever substitution reaches them

  A component body may reference a parameter anywhere a string value sits, and
  link-time substitution replaces all of them — it walks arrays and nested objects
  and skips only `loc`. Both reference checks, in `linkApp` and in `validate`,
  looked instead at a node's own top-level string properties. Substitution was
  deep while validation was shallow, and the asymmetry was the defect.

  A reference nested inside an interaction effect fell through the gap:

  ```
  component c(to: string) {
    button "x" on={event=click, effects=[{kind=navigate, target="$too"}]}
  }
  ```

  `$too` is not a declared parameter, but neither check inspected `effects[0]`, so
  no diagnostic was raised and the misspelling rendered as the literal string
  `"$too"` — a dead navigation target with nothing in the output to say so.

  Both call sites now share one traversal and one reference pattern, so
  substitution and validation cannot disagree about what a reference is or where
  one can appear. Undeclared references in nested objects and in arrays are
  reported with the same message and code as before; correct references and
  partial matches such as `"go to $to"` are unaffected.

  `ATTRIBUTE_SPECS`, `COMPONENT_SPECS`, `GRAMMAR_ELEMENTS`, `BOX_ATTRIBUTES`,
  `INTERACTIVE_ATTRIBUTES` and the lookup helpers around them were already the
  single source the grammar derives from, but they were only reachable through
  the package root — a consumer that wanted the specification had to pull in the
  parser and renderer to get it.

  `@wireweave/core/spec` now serves that surface on its own, built as a separate
  entry so an editor-integration package pays for the spec and nothing else.
  `@wireweave/language-data` is the first consumer: it derives its element and
  attribute vocabulary from this subpath rather than restating it, which is what
  lets a new grammar element fail that package's build until its editor metadata
  exists.

  Additive — the same names remain exported from the root, and no existing entry
  point changed.

### Patch Changes

- [`2f7cc70`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/2f7cc7042da1170bef2f103f7ac25c7d0db3f4c9) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - fix: stop accepting `visibleWhen` / `enabledWhen` on `page`

  Both attributes reached `page` through the shared box-attribute list, so
  `validate()` accepted them — while no renderer emitted anything for them and no
  runtime toggled anything, making the rendered output byte-identical with and
  without the guard. An author could write one, see no diagnostic, and get
  nothing.

  A guarded outcome is emitted by the component render path and read by the site
  runtime. A page is the board that path renders _into_, so there is no element
  for the guard to land on. The declaration is removed rather than the render path
  added: hiding a whole board on state has no meaning in the site shell, where the
  screen a viewer sees is chosen by navigation.

  Every other element that spreads the box list keeps both attributes; only
  `page`'s own surface narrows.

- [`2f7cc70`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/2f7cc7042da1170bef2f103f7ac25c7d0db3f4c9) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - chore: declare the supported Node version on every published package

  Six of the eight packages declared no `engines` at all, so npm installed them
  onto any Node version without a word. The two that did — `@wireweave/cli`
  (`>=18`) and `@wireweave/sdk` (`>=20`) — claimed support for runtimes nothing
  in this repository has ever built or tested against, and were unsatisfiable
  besides: both depend transitively on `@wireweave/core`, so their real floor was
  whatever core's is.

  All eight now declare `node: >=22.13.0`, the version `.nvmrc` pins and the only
  one CI runs. This narrows the advertised range for `cli` and `sdk`; it does not
  narrow what actually worked, it stops advertising support that was never there.

- [`2f7cc70`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/2f7cc7042da1170bef2f103f7ac25c7d0db3f4c9) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - fix: correct the legacy entry fields both packages publish

  `main` is the CommonJS fallback for resolvers that do not read `exports`, and
  `module` is the bundler convention for the ESM build. Both packages pointed
  `main` at the ESM `dist/index.js` while shipping a perfectly good
  `dist/index.cjs`, so a consumer old enough to fall back to `main` got ESM
  syntax it could not parse. `@wireweave/core` additionally set
  `module: dist/index.mjs`, a file tsup has never emitted — webpack, rollup, and
  any vite config that honours `module` resolved core to nothing.

  Both now match the rest of the workspace: `main: dist/index.cjs`,
  `module: dist/index.js`. Modern resolution is unaffected — the `exports` maps
  were already correct and take precedence.

- [`2f7cc70`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/2f7cc7042da1170bef2f103f7ac25c7d0db3f4c9) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - fix: serve CommonJS consumers CommonJS type declarations

  Each of these packages ships both an ESM and a CJS build but declared a single
  `exports` `"types"` entry pointing at the ESM `.d.ts`. TypeScript resolves types
  through the same condition it resolves code, so a consumer doing
  `require('@wireweave/core')` under `moduleResolution: node16`/`bundler` was
  handed declarations that only typecheck when the package is dynamically
  imported — the types said "ESM" while the code said "CJS".

  The maps now split `import` and `require`, each with its own `types`, matching
  the shape `@wireweave/agent-prompts` already used. Every subpath is covered, and
  the `.d.cts` files they point at were already being emitted. No entry point was added or
  removed and every path resolves to the same code as before.

- [`2f7cc70`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/2f7cc7042da1170bef2f103f7ac25c7d0db3f4c9) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - chore: declare `sideEffects: false` on the packages that have none

  Bundlers use this field to decide whether a module may be dropped entirely when
  none of its exports are used. Five packages qualified and none said so, which
  cost consumers dead code in every build that imported one of them for a single
  symbol.

  The claim is verified rather than asserted. `pnpm sideeffects:check` imports
  every `exports` entry of every package making the claim, each in its own
  process, and compares globals, builtin prototypes and `process.env` across the
  import while capturing stdout/stderr from outside and enforcing filesystem,
  process and worker access through Node's permission model. A package is covered
  the moment it adds the field, and the gate fails rather than passing vacuously
  if the set making the claim is ever empty.

- [`2f7cc70`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/2f7cc7042da1170bef2f103f7ac25c7d0db3f4c9) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - chore: serve core's source to the workspace and its dist to npm

  `packages/core` now points `main` / `module` at `src/index.ts` and adds a
  `development` condition to every `exports` entry, so TypeScript,
  typescript-eslint and Vite/Vitest read core's source instead of its build
  output. This removes the ordering dependency that made `lint`, `typecheck` and
  `test` observe a half-written `dist/` when run alongside `build` — a race that
  produced failures naming files the author never touched, and that vanished on
  re-run, which taught readers that red meant nothing.

  What npm receives is unchanged. A `publishConfig` block carries the dist-based
  `main` / `module` / `types` / `exports` map, and pnpm substitutes it at pack
  time; the packaging gate's `publint --strict` run asserts every substituted
  field resolves, and the tarball gate asserts the published archive contains
  exactly what those fields point at and nothing from `src/`.

  - `button` now accepts `aria` / `aria-label` (rendered as `aria-label`) and `title`
    (tooltip + fallback name), giving icon-only buttons a real accessible name
    (WCAG 4.1.2): `button "" icon="x" aria="Close"`. Only emitted when authored —
    buttons with visible text render unchanged.
  - Unknown icon names now render one canonical placeholder everywhere (icon node,
    button icon, input icon) via the new `renderUnknownIconSvg` export — a dashed
    circle with a `?` glyph plus a `title="Unknown icon: <name>"` hover — instead of
    leaking the raw DSL name as literal `[name]` text in button/input.
  - The overflow/kebab-menu aliases now target the real Lucide keys after the

    the placeholder anymore.

  Two rendering fixes for the multi-page canvas, both instances of the fixed-layout
  invariant (see `no-responsive.md`):
  - `renderToHtml` wraps its output in a flex `<body>`. The multi-page `.wf-canvas`
    was a flex item without `flex-shrink: 0`, so it collapsed below its intrinsic
    width when the viewport was narrower than the canvas and the boards reflowed —
    the same defect the single-page `.wf-page` already guards against. The standalone
    wrapper now emits `.wf-canvas { flex-shrink: 0 }` (prefix-aware).
  - `.wf-drawer` used `position: fixed`, so a drawer inside a page escaped to the
    viewport top-left and overlapped other boards in canvas mode. It is now
    `position: absolute`, scoping it to its nearest positioned ancestor
    (`.wf-page` / `.wf-canvas-board`) — the same board-scoping the modal backdrop
    already uses.

## 3.1.0-beta.0

### Minor Changes

- [`2aebfc2`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/2aebfc22072764cb5bfc6d5579ef4e2855cf9918) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - feat: opt-in source anchors (`data-wf-path` / `data-wf-loc`) + DOM↔AST↔source mapping APIs

  Add a `sourceAnchors` render option (default `false`, output byte-identical when off) that stamps each rendered component element with `data-wf-path` (page-relative index path) and `data-wf-loc` (source offset range). New extract APIs invert the mapping: `buildAnchorIndex` / `resolveAnchor` (path ↔ AST node), `getPageSource` / `getNodeSource` (path → DSL source slice), and `buildDomTree` (panel-ready DOM tree). Renderer injection and the index share a single path scheme, so the emitted anchors and the index can never diverge. Additive — existing class/`data-*` contracts are unchanged.

- [`13f22ee`](https://github.com/wireweave/wireweave/commit/13f22ee7239d72cd4e31cb7b22802b4457e3b8a0) Thanks [@Seungwoo321](https://github.com/Seungwoo321)! - feat: canonical `.wf` printer — `printWireframe` (AST → deterministic canonical DSL text) and `formatWireframeCode` (parse + reprint). Single canonical form (fixed indentation, attribute ordering, quoting, blank-line policy) with tested round-trip laws: `parse(print(ast))` is structurally lossless, printing is an idempotent fixpoint, and canonical text reprints byte-identical.

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

- **renderer:** renderCanvas no longer emits chrome / grid / labels.
  The renderer now produces a single bounded `<div class="wf-canvas">` of the
  exact layout extent containing absolutely-positioned `<div class="wf-canvas-board">`
  wrappers. Hosts (dashboard infinite-canvas viewer, markdown-plugin, vscode-extension,
  SVG export) are responsible for chrome, grid, pan-zoom, and labels.

Removed:

- `CanvasChrome` type and `chrome` / `canvasBackground` options on `CanvasOptions`
- chrome routing in `render()` / `renderToSvg()`

Added:

- `page "X" at(x, y) { ... }` grammar — canvas coordinates resolved into
  `Page.x` / `Page.y` for explicit placement; pages without `at(...)` auto-flow
  horizontally with configurable gap (default 64px)
- `renderPage(page)` — pure single-page export primitive
- `renderCanvas(doc, opts?)` — multi-page composition (gap-only options)
- `layoutCanvas(pages, gap?)` — pure utility that returns `{ placed, width, height }`
  so hosts can compose their own DOM
- `PlacedPage` public type
- `data-page-x` / `data-page-y` / `data-page-w` / `data-page-h` /
  `data-page-title` attributes on each board for host-DOM communication

Migration:

- `renderCanvas(doc, { chrome: 'editor' })` → `renderCanvas(doc)` and let the host
  apply its own chrome (Figma-style grid is the dashboard editor's responsibility)
- `chrome: 'preview'` consumers (markdown-plugin, vscode-extension preview)
  already work — they don't pass `chrome` and now receive bare bounded layout
