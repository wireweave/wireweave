/**
 * A narrowing of one registry attribute, scoped to one element.
 *
 * {@link AttributeSpec} is a flat namespace keyed by attribute name alone, so it
 * can only state what an attribute means everywhere at once. Some facts are not
 * of that shape: `name` on `icon` is a glyph out of a closed 1.6k-name set,
 * while `name` on `radio` is whatever string groups the radios. An override
 * carries the narrower fact for the one element it holds on, and the wider one
 * stays in the registry for everybody else.
 *
 * Narrowing only, in both directions:
 * - `name` is absent from this type, so an override cannot rename an attribute
 *   and therefore cannot bring a name into existence that the registry has not
 *   already declared.
 * - `values` may only shrink an existing domain, and `type` may only move to
 *   `enum` from an open one. `spec-override-containment.test.ts` in
 *   `packages/language-data` holds both, because an override that widened would
 *   be a second registry hiding behind a lookup function.
