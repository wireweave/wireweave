// Generated-artifact freshness gate — the post-Build half.
//
// Run the generators, then assert the working tree is unchanged. If a generator
// produces something different from what is committed, the commit is stale.
//
// The judgement is `git status`, not `git diff`, and the difference is the whole
// point. `git diff` compares the index and the working tree, so it is blind to
// files git does not track — a generator can emit a brand-new artifact and
// `git diff --exit-code` stays silent forever. That is not hypothetical: every
// artifact this gate currently sees is untracked, so its predecessor
// (`git diff --exit-code -- '*.tmLanguage.generated.json'`) could not fail no
// matter what the generators wrote. A gate that cannot observe its subject is
// worse than no gate, because it also reports success.
//
// So the four ways a generated artifact can be wrong are checked separately,
// each with its own diagnosis:
//
//   untracked  the artifact exists but git has never been told about it — the
//              blind spot above, and the reason this file replaced a diff
//   ignored    .gitignore excludes it, so it can never be committed; the gate
//              and .gitignore are asserting opposite things about the same file
//   modified   regenerating produced different bytes — the classic stale commit
//   deleted    the committed artifact is gone from the tree
//
// The set is derived, never listed. `*.generated.*` is the repo's naming
// convention for a committed build artifact, and git enumerates what matches;
// adding a generator therefore needs no edit here. A second hand-maintained
// list is the defect this whole task is removing, not a tool to reach for.
//
// Two artifacts sit outside the convention and are deliberately not in scope:
// packages/core/src/parser/generated-parser.js has its own dedicated gate
// (packages/core/scripts/check-generated-parser.mjs) which re-runs Peggy and
// compares bytes, and reports a missing artifact explicitly — it must run
// BEFORE Build, since Build overwrites it. Everything under node_modules/ and
// dist/ is third-party or ignored build output that no one commits. The root
// .local/ directory owns disposable local artifacts, including release worktrees.
//
// Paths are relative to the repository root; callers run from there.
